<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mashed potatoes, sweet corn, gravy, cheese, and crispy chicken all stuffed into a bowl. That’s the genius mixture of the KFC Famous Bowl. They’re amazing but as you’d expect from a lineup like that, they’re not the healthiest meal option around town.</p>
<p>The original KFC Famous Bowl has 720 calories, 26 grams of protein, 79 grams of carbs, and 34 grams of fat. While this recipe makes two copycat bowls, I’ll combine their macros for comparison, bringing the total to 600 calories, 48 grams of protein, 52 grams of carbs, and 22 grams of fat. So, if you eat this recipe in its entirety, you’ll still save 120 calories and gain an additional 22 grams of protein. Nice.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>12 oz Frozen Cauliflower Rice</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Light Butter</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp Black Pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 C Whole Kernel Corn, drained</li>
    <li>1/4 C Beef Gravy</li>
    <li>1/4 C Reduced Fat Shredded Cheddar</li>
    <li>16 pieces Spicy Popcorn Chicken</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Microwave the cauliflower rice for 4-5 minutes and drain any remaining liquid before adding to a food processor or blender with the butter and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Blend until smooth like mashed potatoes. You may be able to accomplish this with a masher or really fine whisk, but it will take some work.</li>
    <li>Open a can of corn and drain any liquid before microwaving 1/2 cup for 60-90 seconds or until warm. Measure the beef gravy and microwave for 30-60 seconds or until warm.</li>
    <li>Add half the mashed cauliflower to a bowl before adding half the corn, gravy, and 8 pieces of popcorn chicken. Sprinkle half the shredded cheddar and repeat for the second bowl.</li>
